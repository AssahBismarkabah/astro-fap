# Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript is a versatile programming language that powers the modern web. This guide will help you understand the fundamentals and advanced concepts of JavaScript.

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. It is multi-paradigm, supporting:

- Object-oriented programming
- Imperative programming
- Functional programming

## Key Features

1. **Dynamic Typing**
   - Variables can hold different types of values
   - Type checking happens at runtime

2. **First-class Functions**
   - Functions can be assigned to variables
   - Functions can be passed as arguments
   - Functions can be returned from other functions

3. **Event-Driven Programming**
   - Responds to user actions
   - Handles asynchronous operations

## Getting Started

```javascript
// Your first JavaScript program
console.log('Hello, World!');

// Variables and data types
let message = 'Welcome to JavaScript';
const pi = 3.14159;
let isActive = true;

// Functions
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```
